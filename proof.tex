\textbf{Linear Stochastic Error Recursion (LSER)} The error dynamics for the LSA in \eqref{eq:lsa} i.e., the dynamics of $e_t\eqdef\theta_t-\ts$ can be written as follows:
\begin{align}\label{errprelim}
&\theta_t-\ts=\theta_{t-1}-\ts+\alpha(g_t -H_t(\theta_t-\ts+\ts)),\text{~or}\nn\\
&e_t=(I-\alpha H_t)e_{t-1}+(N_t-M_t\ts).
\end{align}
In what follows we consider what we call linear stochastic error recursion (LSER) given by
\begin{align}\label{lsergen}
e_t=(I-\alpha H_t)e_{t-1}+\alpha \zeta_t,
\end{align}
where $\zeta_t\eqdef (N_t-M_t\ts)$.
