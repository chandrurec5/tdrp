Temporal Difference Learning: Revisiting convergence of Linear stochastic approximation finite time and asymptotic analysis.

Messages

1) Cannot get rid of problem dependence in TD =>Sensitive to conditioning (this shows up even in additive analysis for MSE in general quadratic norm). 

2) We expect same thing to hold for GTD, but following issues with analysis

a) Finite time multiplicative noise analysis not applicable for GTD, 
b) saddle point analysis requires projection. 
c) GTD-MP requires double samples and defeats the purpose.

What to do => Go back to stochastic approximation and look at ODE

3) GTD is slow, What can be done? Introduce beta parameter.
